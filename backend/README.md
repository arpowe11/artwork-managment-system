# Artwork Management System: Project Report

## 1. Introduction

The Artwork Management System is a backend project designed to manage digital artwork data efficiently and securely. The project consists of two major components:

1. **Backend API** implemented in **Java Spring Boot**
2. **Data ingestion and processing** implemented in **Python**

The system provides a secure RESTful API for CRUD operations on artwork data, ensuring proper access control and protection of sensitive data.

## 2. Choice of Technologies

### 2.1 Python for Data Ingestion

Python was chosen to connect to the Artwork API and upload data to MongoDB. Key reasons:

* **Ease of use and readability:** Python allows rapid development of scripts to retrieve and process JSON data.
* **Rich library ecosystem:** Libraries like `requests` (for HTTP requests) and `pymongo` (for MongoDB operations) make integration straightforward.
* **Cross-platform compatibility:** Scripts run on Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification.
* **Rapid prototyping:** Python allows quick iteration for data ingestion tasks.
* **JSON handling:** Python natively supports JSON operations, which is crucial for working with API data.

Using Python ensures data from the external API can be fetched, transformed, and stored efficiently in MongoDB.

### 2.2 Java Spring Boot for Backend

Spring Boot was chosen for the backend API due to:

* **Rapid application development:** Pre-configured templates and starter dependencies simplify API creation.
* **Robust ecosystem:** Seamless integration with Spring Data (MongoDB) and Spring Security reduces boilerplate.
* **Scalability and maintainability:** Strong typing and modular project structure improve maintainability.
* **Security support:** Built-in support for JWT authentication and role-based authorization.
* **Industry-standard:** Spring Boot is widely used in enterprise environments.

## 3. Backend Architecture

The backend follows a **layered architecture**:

1. **Controller Layer:** Handles HTTP requests and maps endpoints to service methods.
2. **Service Layer:** Contains business logic, such as creating, updating, and validating artworks.
3. **Repository Layer:** Performs CRUD operations on MongoDB via Spring Data.

**Example:**

```java
public Artwork createArtwork(Artwork artwork) {
    if (artworkRepository.existsById(artwork.getId())) {
        throw new ResponseStatusException(HttpStatus.CONFLICT, "Artwork already exists");
    }
    return artworkRepository.save(artwork);
}
```

This separation of concerns improves maintainability and testability.

## 4. Security Implementation

### 4.1 JWT-Based Authentication

Security is implemented using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**:

1. Users register or log in via `/api/v1/auth/register` or `/api/v1/auth/login`.
2. Server generates a JWT containing username and roles (e.g., `ROLE_USER` or `ROLE_ADMIN`).
3. Client includes the JWT in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

4. Spring Security validates the token using a custom `JwtAuthenticationFilter` and sets the userâ€™s identity in the security context.

### 4.2 Security Configuration

The `SecurityConfig` class enforces endpoint access:

```java
.authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
    .requestMatchers("/api/v1/auth/**").permitAll()
    .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.GET, "/api/v1/artworks/**").hasAnyRole("USER","ADMIN")
    .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.POST, "/api/v1/artworks/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
    .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.PUT, "/api/v1/artworks/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
    .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.DELETE, "/api/v1/artworks/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
)
```

* **Public endpoints:** `register` and `login` are open to all users.
* **USER role:** Can perform GET requests.
* **ADMIN role:** Can perform GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests.
* **Stateless sessions:** JWT ensures each request carries authentication info.

This ensures **role-based access control** and secure API endpoints.

## 5. MongoDB Integration

MongoDB stores artwork and user data. Benefits:

* **Flexible schema:** Artwork fields can vary without database migrations.
* **High performance:** Efficient read/write operations, ideal for batch ingestion via Python.
* **Easy integration:** Spring Data MongoDB maps Java models directly to collections.

Python scripts use `pymongo` to fetch and upload data from the Artwork API.

---

## 6. Advantages of This Setup

* Rapid backend development with Spring Boot
* Python ETL scripts for easy API data ingestion
* Secure stateless authentication with JWT
* Role-based access control for sensitive endpoints
* Flexible, high-performance MongoDB storage
* Maintainable project structure with clear separation of layers

---

## 7. Conclusion

This project demonstrates a robust, secure, and maintainable backend system for artwork management. Python was selected for **data ingestion** due to simplicity and strong library support, while Spring Boot provided a **reliable backend API**. JWT authentication ensures authorized access, and MongoDB provides flexible storage for artwork data.

The project exemplifies **modern software engineering practices**, combining efficient data processing, secure API design, and role-based access control.
